# About Me
Hello! I am Zy yo.

I like uhhh volleyball and ermmm video-games and errrrrr roblox. I want to code things and expand my knowledge of all things about computers and technology. I also love drawing and being an artist. Coding could help me my art life by making games and models, or a app/page that sticks out to the user.

### Career
My top career choice as of now is being an art director. I’ve thought about art as a career choice for a while since I am decent at it and I’ve had some suggestions about it. My primary reason for choosing to be an art director is also because I really don’t know what to do in the future and what to work as. One of my lifestyle goals is that I take art or drawing as a hobby for my entire life, even if it’s just occasional drawing. I also want to be more creative and improve my art. This course can also help me with that by trying to be creative in my coding and such to help expand my creativity. I believe I can also improve my communication and time management by constantly working in my computer science course to help enhance my skills to be a successful art director.
